# Welcome to our projcet üëã
### In this project we implement a directed weighted graph in Python language

### This Object Oriented Programming task was written by:

* Eran Levy - 311382360
* Etay Matzliah - 205987795

 ### How to run the project:
 
 TODO!! 

 ### Our project is divided to two main Interfaces and one class we have added :
 
 #### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Interface GraphInterface : building the foundation of the graph, this interface implemented by the Diagraph.py class

 #### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Interface GraphAlgoInterface : building the algorithm of the graph, this interface implemented by the GraphAlgo.py class
 
 #### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Class NodeData : represent the nodes in the graph, the nodes are hold in a dictionary in this key,value order - {node_key , node_data} 
 
-------------------------------------

#### The algorithms that we used in this project is : 

1 . BFS algorithms : this algorithm helps us to find the shortestPath between src to dest and how many scc we have in the graph and on a spesfic node

 #### üïê Time complexity of the algorithms:
 
 - BFS algorithms = O(V + E)
 
   V = vertex
    
	 E = edges
